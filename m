Well, we first setup ->ops[type], then load quota inode, and only after
that enable flags which sb_has_quota_active() is checking so I don't see a
need for additional checking of dqopt->ops[qid->type].

The problematic code was merged in this merge window so no point to cc
stable. I want to push the fix to Linus for rc3 (likely today or tomorrow)
so you should be able to get that soon. Sorry for complications.
