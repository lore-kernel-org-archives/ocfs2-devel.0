This, please.

You still haven't explained where this deactivate_locked_super() call
is coming from.  Oh well.

Well from a design perspective, putting the rcu_barrier() in the vfs is
the *correct* place.  Individual filesystems shouldn't be hard-coding
knowledge about vfs internal machinery.

A neater implementation might be to add a kmem_cache* argument to
unregister_filesystem().  If that is non-NULL, unregister_filesystem()
does the rcu_barrier() and destroys the cache.  That way we get to
delete (rather than add) a bunch of code from all filesystems and new
and out-of-tree filesystems cannot forget to perform the rcu_barrier().

That is not what I proposed.
