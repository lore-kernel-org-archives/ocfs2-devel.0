So if bio_add_page() requires bi_rw to be set, then shouldn't it be
set up for every caller? I noticed there are about 50 call sites for
bio_add_page(), and you've only touched about 10 of them. Indeed, I
notice that the RAID0/1 code uses bio_add_page, and as that can be
stacked on top of RAID456, it also needs to set bi_rw correctly.
As a result, your patch set is nowhere near complete, not does it
document that bio_add_page requires that bi_rw be set before calling
(which is the new API requirement, AFAICT).

So, my question is whether the RAID456 code is doing something
valid.  That write optimisation is clearly not enabled for a
significant amount of code and filesystems, so the first thing to do
is quantify the benefit of the optimisation. I can't evalute the
merit of this change without data telling me it is worthwhile, and
it's a lot of code to churn for no benefit....

Cheers,

Dave.
