I'm not a fan of hidden behaviors like that, particularly when we
already have a flags field where callers can explicitly ask for the
to-eof behavior.

CAN_SHORTEN isn't included everywhere -- FICLONE{,RANGE} don't enable it
because they have no way to communicate the number of bytes cloned back
to userspace.  Either we can clone every byte the user asked for, or we
send back -EINVAL.  (Maybe I'm misinterpreting what you meant by 'solved
by including it everywhere'?)

For now it's superfluous.  At first I was thinking that we could return
a short bytes_deduped if, say, the first part of the range actually did
match, but it became pretty obvious via shared/010 that duperemove can't
handle that, so we really must stick to the existing btrfs behavior.

The existing btrfs behavior is that we can round the length down to
avoid deduping partial EOF blocks, but we return the original length
(i.e. lie) in bytes_deduped when we do that.

I sort of thought about introducing a new copy_file_range flag that
would just do deduplication and allow for opportunistic "dedup as much
as you can" but ... meh.  Maybe I'll just drop the patch instead; we can
revisit that when anyone wants a better dedupe interface.

Sounds good to me.
