The behavior has never been consistent -- since the beginning you can
keep write()ing to a fd after the file becomes immutable, but you can't
ftruncate() it.  I would really like to make the behavior consistent.
Since the authors of nearly every new system call and ioctl since the
late 1990s have interpreted S_IMMUTABLE to mean "immutable takes effect
everywhere immediately" I resolved the inconsistency in favor of that
interpretation.

I asked Ted what he thought that that userspace having the ability to
continue writing to an immutable file, and he thought it was an
implementation bug that had been there for 25 years.  Even he thought
that immutable should take effect immediately everywhere.

FWIW Ted also thought that since it's rare for admins to set +i on a
file actively in use we could just change it without forcing everyone
onto a new api.
