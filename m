This change is now dependent on the preceeding direct IO API
changes. Do I a) take the DIO API change through the XFS tree, or
b) use the older version of the patch that didn't have this
dependency and let somebody else deal with the API change and merge
issues?

I'm happy to take the DIO API change through the XFS tree, if that's
the fastest/easiest way to get the necessary DIO subsystem fixes
into the mainline tree for XFS. As such, the for-next tree that I'm
building right now will include the DIO API change patch....

-Dave.
