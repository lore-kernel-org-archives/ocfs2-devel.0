Nic wanted this as the target code is the biggest user of configfs.
I don't really care where it goes as long as we get in the current version
into a stable not to be rebased branch somehwere so that all consumers
can use that as a base point.

Nic, can you do that?  A lot of previous work went in through Andrew, but I
think -mm is still a quilt stack so the stable base branch wouldn't be
possible that way.
