The ext3/4 code has long been able to handle open-unlinked files
properly after a crash (they are put into a singly-linked list from
the superblock on disk that is processed after journal recovery).

The issue here is that blocking freeze from succeeding with open-
unlinked files is an unreasonable assumption of this patch, and
I don't think it is acceptable to land this patchset (which IMHO
would prevent nearly every Gnome system from freezing unless these
apps have changed their behaviour in more recent releases).

Like you suggest, filesystems that handle this correctly should be
able to flag or otherwise indicate that this is OK, and allow the
freeze to continue.  For other filesystems that do not handle
open-unlinked file consistency during a filesystem freeze/snapshot
whether this should even be considered a new case, or is something
that has existed for ages already.

The other question is whether this is still a problem even for
filesystems handling the consistency issue, but from Jan's comment
above there is a new locking issue related to mmap_sem being added?

Cheers, Andreas
