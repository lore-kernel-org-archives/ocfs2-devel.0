	Oh, frozen_data protects that sort of thing.  The concern is
that the old block type is in the committing transaction, and the new
block type is in the running transaction.  But the trigger type is from
the new block type, and not valid to call against the committing block
in the committing transaction.

	Well, it only does on the frozen-data check.  I suppose that
could be pulled into the abort_trigger() function.  Maybe an additional
patch?

	Thanks for taking a look!
