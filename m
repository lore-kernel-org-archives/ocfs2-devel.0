[-cc individual fs maintainers to avoid all of these email bounces,
should've looked a bit closer at that get_maintainer.pl output...]

I agree that this is a bit more readable, but it evaluates i twice.
That's an easy fix, just do __iter.type instead of (i)->type, but
there's still the possibility of someone passing in something called
__iter as i, and the fix for that tends to be "add more underscores". At
the very least, Al's macro could probably use a comment explaining
what's going on there, though.
