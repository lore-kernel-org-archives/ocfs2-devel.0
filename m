	I chatted with Mark some about this today.  He pointed out that,
logically, b_data can't be checkpointed until its data isn't in the
journal - it might be newer than the most recent transaction.  So I
looked in the checkpoint code to see where this is handled, and the
checkpoint code simply forces a commit new enough to encompass b_data
when it wants to put that block to disk.
	In other words, I think that the commit trigger is safe in all
circumstances once moved up in journal_commit_transaction().  I'll be
cooking that up shortly.
