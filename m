I did try changing the patches to pass inode.
But, there are a few instances that made me think that keeping
super_block was beneficial.

1. There are a few link, rename functions which assign times like this:

-       inode->i_ctime = dir->i_ctime = dir->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;
+       inode->i_ctime = dir->i_ctime = dir->i_mtime =
current_fs_time(dir->i_sb);

Now, if we pass in inode, we end up making 2 calls to current_fs_time().
We could actually just use 1 call because for all parameters the
function uses, they are identical.
But, it seems odd to assume that the function wouldn't use the inode,
even though it is getting passed in to the function.

2. Also, this means that we will make it an absolute policy that any filesystem
timestamp that is not directly connected to an inode would have to use
ktime_get_* apis.
Some timestamps use the same on disk format and might be useful to
have same api to be reused.
Eg: [patch 6/21] of the current series

3. Even if the filesystem inode has extra timestamps and these are not
part of vfs inode, we still use
vfs inode to get the timestamps from current_fs_time(): Eg: ext4 create time

4. And, filesystem attributes must be assigned only after the inode is
created or use ktime apis.
And, only when these get assigned to inode, they will call timespec_trunc().

5. 2 and 3 might lead to more code rearrangement for few filesystems.
These will lead to more patches probably and they will not be mechanical.

If these are not a problem, I can update the series that accepts inode as an
argument instead of super_block.
