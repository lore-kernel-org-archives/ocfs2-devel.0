OK Thanks I'll use that then. 
(And BUILD_BUG_ON to make sure)

That's what I don't like. In compatibility problems situation, we actually
have two kind of structures. I rather that they are spelled out explicitly
and chosen from at the appropriate places. But I'll give up it is probably
just me. (Though proof that it was not me who raised the subject)

I would at least expect a big fat comment explaining what happened to the
structure on what known ARCHs, and how it is expected to look in memory.
And a BUILD_BUG_ON to make sure of that.

Thanks, the __attribute((packed,aligned(__WORD_SIZE))) is new for me
