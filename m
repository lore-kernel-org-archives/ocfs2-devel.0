My 48 core test results for these patches as applied to 2.6.35 can be 
found at:

http://free.linux.hp.com/~enw/ext4/2.6.35

Both the Boxacle large_file_creates and random_writes workloads improved 
significantly and consistently with these patches, and apparently in the 
single threaded case as well as at increased scale.
The graphs at the URL show one instance of several runs I made to 
establish repeatability.

I've also taken unmodified 2.6.35 ext4, ext4 without a journal, and xfs 
data for comparison.  In addition, I've collected lock stats and more 
detailed performance data for reference.

Thanks, Ted!
Eric
