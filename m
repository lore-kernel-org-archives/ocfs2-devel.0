Hi Andreas,

	Thanks for posting this. I believe that an interface such as FIEMAP
would be very useful to Ocfs2 as well. (I added ocfs2-devel to the e-mail)

My comments below are generally geared towards understanding the ioctl
interface.

I'm a little bit confused by fe_offset. Is it a physical offset, or a
logical offset? The reason I ask is that your description above says "FIEMAP
ioctl will return the logical to physical mapping for the extent that
contains the specified logical byte address." Which seems to imply physical,
but your math to get to the next logical start in a very fragmented file,
implies that fe_offset is a logical offset:

       fm_start = fm_extents[fm_extent_count - 1].fe_offset +
                         fm_extents[fm_extent_count - 1].fe_length + 1;

I think you meant 'fm_length' instead of 'fm_end' there.

Btw, I really like that holes are explicitely marked.

Is "EOF" here considering "beyond i_size" or "beyond allocation"?

Would it be valid to use FIEMAP_EXTENT_NO_DIRECT for marking in-inode data?
Btrfs, Ocfs2, and Gfs2 pack small amounts of user data directly in inode
blocks.
