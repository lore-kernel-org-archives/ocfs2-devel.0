> But your version is less logically efficient for the case where "type == READ" is true and "flags & RWF_NONBLOCK" is false because your version then has to do the "if (type == WRITE" check before discovering it does not need to take that branch either, whilst the original version does not have to do such a test at all.

Of course seriously.

The original version is more readable (IMO) and this is not a micro-optimization.  It is people like you who are responsible for the fact that we need faster and faster computers to cope with the inefficient/poor code being written more and more...

And I really wouldn't hedge my bets on gcc optimizing something like that.  The amount of crap assembly produced from gcc that I have seen over the years suggests that it is quite likely it will make a hash of it instead...

Best regards,
