I figured it was easy enough to accommodate the multiple destructor case
but you are right that is overkill given the current (and realistically,
expected) usage, I'll change that for the next round.

(that's assuming we don't end up with some scheme where the struct page
* is in the destructor struct like I was investigating previously to
alleviate the frag size overhead. I guess this illustrates nicely why
that approach got ugly: these array propagate all the way up the call
chain if you do that)

Sure thing, I should have made it clear in my intro mail that I was
aiming for 3.4.

Thanks,
