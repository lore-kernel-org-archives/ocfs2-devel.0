Generic implementation of SEEK_HOLE & SEEK_DATA in
generic_file_llseek_size() and default_llseek() behaved as if everything
within i_size is data and everything beyond i_size is a hole. That makes
sense at the first sight (and definitely is a valid implementation of
the spec) but at the second sight it isn't very useful. If anyone
bothers with looking for holes / data, he should be better told we don't
really know so that he can fall back to his chosen backup strategy
(think of e.g. cp(1)).

This is a userspace API change however the kernel interface is there
only for two years so hopefully userspace is still prepared to handle
EINVAL return value.
