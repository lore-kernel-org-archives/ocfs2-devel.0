So please reproduce it on a brd/scsi/sata/virtio block device before
going any further. Preferably with a bash script I can point at a
single block device, not a binary initrd blob that I have to
deconstruct to try to work out what your test is doing.

because this:

says that nbd is going through I/O error land, and that's the most
likely cause of problems being seen by higher level IO completion
operations....

And that's deep inside the workqueue infrastructure, indicating that
rescues are being used (allocation deadlock?) which is also less
tested error handling code path....

and it has happened deep inside the nbd IO path in the context of
the xfs_buf allocation that has seen corruptions in previous dumps.

So before I look any further at this, you need to rule out nbd as
the cause of the problems because the XFS code paths on scsi, sata,
brd and virtio block device don't cause any problems....

Cheers,

Dave.
