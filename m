	Filesystems that handle their own page cache certainly wouldn't
be interested in a generic helper anyway.  All of our pagecache assumes
blocks between 512<->PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.
	If I change the BUG_ON()s to -EINVAL, does that work?  Or do you
have some way you'd like to allow non-pagecache filesystems to use this
as well?
