This would be useful and could be added later if individual
filesystems choose to add the mount functionality.  My goal with
this patchset is to enable only minimal functionality so
that other kernel developers can build on it.

If the sb is mostly unused, there should be few puts.  But you
are correct that if the backend has only very limited space,
cleancache adds cost and has little value.  On these systems,
cleancache should probably be disabled.  However, the cost
is very small so leaving it enabled may not even show a
measureable performance impact.

Yes, I think an SSD backend is very interesting, especially
if the SSD is "very near" to the processor so that it can
be used as a RAM extension rather than as an I/O device.

The existing cleancache hooks will work for this and I am
working on a cleancache backend called RAMster that will
be a good foundation to access other asynchronous devices.

Thanks for your feedback!
