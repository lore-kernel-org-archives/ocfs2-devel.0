Like you, I keep thinking back to this patch and going back and forth.
But to answer your question:  in some cases, the name of the file
(plus the context of the directory in which it is created) can tell
you what assumptions userspace will make about it.  And userspace most
definately is a part of the TCB, i.e. /bin/passwd and /bin/login.
