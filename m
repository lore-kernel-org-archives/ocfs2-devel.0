Yeah I went back and forth on this.  KEEP_SIZE won't change the behavior of
PUNCH_HOLE since PUNCH_HOLE implicitly means keep the size.  I figured since its
"mode" and not "flags" it would be ok to make either way accepted, but if you
prefer PUNCH_HOLE means you have to have KEEP_SIZE set then I'm cool with that,
just let me know one way or the other.  Thanks,

Josef
