Hi all,

A lot of people find it hard to setup their first cluster or simply
don?t have time to repeat the same setup over and over, either for
development or do some basic testing or to showcase cluster technologies
to other people.

The  "Cluster in a BOX" project (cbox in short), is one script to setup
a KVM based virtual test cluster in a matter of few minutes.

cbox is still in its early development, has several limitations and some
strict requirements.

Plans are to include as many cluster technologies and configuration
examples as possible and remove as many limitations as we possibly can.

If your cluster project or technology is not there yet, or your
distribution is not supported, it?s simply because I do not have the
resources to do all by myself. Do not take it personally, we will get it
there together and I absolutely welcome comments, patches and feedback
at any time.

Support for pacemaker, DRBD and OCFS2 will come shortly.

cbox documentation is here (in temporary lack of a more neutral location):

http://sources.redhat.com/cluster/wiki/cluster_in_a_box

Please read it carefully before running cbox.

Fabio
