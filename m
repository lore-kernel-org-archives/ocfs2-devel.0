Hi Minchan --

Thanks for your thorough review!  I don't think anyone
else yet has examined the semantics of the cleancache
patch as deeply as you have.  Excellent!

I agree it doesn't seem to be the right place, but it does work
and there doesn't seem to be a better place.

I think the "if (PageUptodate(page))" eliminates all the cases
where bad things can happen.

Note that there may be cases where some unnecessary puts/flushes
occur.  The focus of the patch is on correctness first; it may
be possible to increase performance (marginally) in the future by
reducing unnecessary cases.

This is definitely very important but remember that cleancache
provides a great deal of flexibility:  Any page in cleancache
can be thrown away at any time as every page is clean!  It
can even accept a page and throw it away immediately.  Clearly
the backend needs to do this intelligently so this will
take some policy work.

Since I saw you sent a separate response to Nitin, I'll
let him answer for his in-kernel page cache compression
work.  The solution to the similar problem for Xen is
described in the tmem internals document that I think
I pointed to earlier here:
http://oss.oracle.com/projects/tmem/documentation/internals/ 

Thanks,
Dan
