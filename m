TBH, I'm not sure I like such calling conventions, but I guess we can
live with that.

... and easily avoided if you use a macro instead of inline, without losing
type safety or getting double evaluation, etc.

Look: 0 ? (struct T *)0 : (x) always evaluates to x.  Now look at 6.5.15p3 in
C99: the second and the third arguments are both pointers, so we are left with
p3.4 (both arguments are pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of
compatible types), p3.5 (one operand is a pointer and another null pointer
constant) and p3.6 (one operand is a pointer to an object or incomplete type,
and the other is a pointer to qualified or unqualied version of void.

The first variant means that x is a pointer to qualified or unqualified
struct T; the type of result is, per 6.5.15p6, the same as that of x.

The second variant means that x is a null pointer constant ((struct T *)0 isn't
one) and result is a null pointer to T.

The third one means that x is a pointer to qualified or unqualified void.
The type of result is the same as that of x.

Now note that your variant is no better wrt type safety; worse, actually, since
it does accept any pointer to void.  (0 ? (struct iov_iter *)0 : (x))->type
will reject those.  And we obviously don't have double evaluation here either.
