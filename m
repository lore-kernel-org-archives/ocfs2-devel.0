This just means we have a flag to mean ken is 0 and needs to be filled,
rather than encoding that in the field itself.  If you fell better we
can replace 0 with 0xffffffff and still encode it in the field.

Include it everywhere as in allow it in ever ->remap_file instance.

Sounds fine to me.  The btrfs ioctl is really ugly, but then again
there is no pressing need for something better.
