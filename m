Hey Joel,

I'm not sure you saw this e-mail, since I think it got in a mailman
moderation queue.

I've been looking more closely at this, and I think actually using
this commit trigger gets very tricky.  Exactly how do you plan to use
the commit trigger?  The caller is only going to be able to easily
check the checksum on the frozen copy of the buffer; is that what you
intended?  When and how do you plan set the checksum for a filesystem
which is cleanly unmounted?  And are you planning on doing this for
just the superblock, or for other data structures?
