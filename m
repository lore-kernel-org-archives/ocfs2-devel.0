	I've flagged you as "do not moderate".  I saw the email, but I
was in Prague for the cluster summit and didn't have time to look
in-depth.

	Every single metadata block in ocfs2 would have the commit
trigger set.  I intend to calculate the block checksums in the trigger.
That way I only compute the checksum once per journal write, rather than
every time I call journal_dirty_metadata().  That's my plan, at least.
	You may be right that my choice is too late and that I need to
trigger in an earlier place.  That's why I was taking time to reply: I
wanted to re-read the jbd2 source and be sure of what you were saying
and how I was handling it.  I haven't looked yet (just got back to the
office today), but here's what I understand so far.
	As far I could tell, actual writes of the buffer to the journal
go through journal_write_metadata_buffer().  Only in
journal_write_metadata_buffer() are you sure to have a frozen copy of
the buffer that won't be affected by parallel processes doing
journal_dirty_metadata().  Thus, the new_page and new_offset values are
set to b_data or b_frozen_data as needed.  When I get past that, I have
the right pointer.  I need to do it before the escape, of course,
because I want to checksum the block data, not the escaped data.
	Now, I'm sure this is the buffer that's going to the journal, I
think you're saying that this buffer may not be what gets checkpointed.
So the correct checksum hits the journal, but then an invalid one gets
to the real location on disk.  Is that right?  If so, I need to figure
out where to calculate the checksum somewhere higher, as you say.
