Sure, but if XFs is at the end of the list of filesystems to try to
mount, then you'll get allt he other filesystems attempted first,
lik eis being seen. And the absence of a single message in dmesg
from XFS is kind of suspicious, because XFs is by far the noisest of
all filesystems when it comes to warning about bad superblocks....

No filesystem should impact on any other filesystem.

However, we have seen in the past that when filesystems share slab
caches that a bug in one filesystem can cause problems in another.
For example, years ago there was a bug in Reiserfs causing bufferhead
corruption that only affected other XFS filesystems on the same
machine.

That doesn't tell you it is an XFS error. Absence of symptoms !=
absence of bug.

Again, it doesn't tell you that it is an XFS bug. XFS is well known
for exposing bugs in less used block devices, and you are definitely
using devices that are unusual and not commonly tested by filesystem
developers (e.g. zram, nbd, etc).

You need to refine the test down from "throw shit at the wall, look
at what sticks" to a simple, reproducable test case. I can't
reproduce your systems or testing, so you need to provide a test
case I can use. Otherwise we're just wasting time....

> So it may well be that XFS is impacted by an early run of itself.

You haven't provided any evidence that XFS is even finding bad
superblocks. As I said before, XFS is extremely loud when you
attempt to mount a corrupt image. I test this regularly on real
block devices, and I've never, ever had it fall over.

e.g:

$ sudo umount /dev/vda
$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/vda bs=512 count=128
128+0 records in
128+0 records out
65536 bytes (66 kB) copied, 0.0205057 s, 3.2 MB/s
$ sync
$ sudo !!
sudo mount /dev/vda /mnt/test
mount: block device /dev/vda is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: you must specify the filesystem type
$ dmesg

$

Note the gigantic, noisy stack trace that XFS leaves behind when it
fails to validate a superblock? And the hexdump telling you what was
in the block that it read? That's the output that the commit your
bisect landed on adds. Now, if you are telling me that this commit
is causing the problems, then where's the output in dmesg from it?
It's clearly not so broken as to simply fail all the time, so you
should be seeing *thousands* of these traces in your logs.

If you aren't seeing any of these traces, then the first thing you
need to do is work out why. The code is not obviously broken, and I
can't break it here myself, so that suggests there's something
special in what you are doing...

Cheers,

Dave.
