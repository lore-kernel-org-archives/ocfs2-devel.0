If the file system is mounted read-write, and it is transitioning to
read-only, i.e. "mount -o remount,ro /" then you do want to write out
all dirty data before you transition it to be read-only (otherwise you
would lose data).

It is my belief that this is the _only_ data integrity issue which is
implied by remount (and this is more about not losing work done by
previous system calls).

The background reason for this commit is that a user complained on the
ext4 list that he is using containers in a virtualization environment,
and due to the init scripts which the user doesn't want to change, it
is causing gazillions of no-op remounts, and this is causing ext4 (and
xfs) to do send CACHE FLUSH commands because it is required by the
syncfs(2) system call, which also calls sync_filesystem.  These CACHE
FLUSH commands are unneeded for anything, especially for these no-op
remounts, and so I want them to go away for remounts, but they should
still be there in response to syncfs(2) requests.

Cheers,
