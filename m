  Well, syncfs() in RO->RW transition clearly isn't needed. In RW->RO
transition basically everybody needs it. What is disputable is the case of
RW->RW remounts and I could imagine someone relying on syncfs() there
although 99% of filesystems don't need it. So I agree in principle with
moving the responsibility for syncfs() to ->remount so that each filesystem
can decide.

  Yes, some people do use UDF for USB sticks - Linux supports it in
read-write mode as well (although with somewhat limited set of features).
But the filesystem's I've named are those which clearly either bail with
error if RW mount is attempted or silently change it to RO mount. In these
cases, I'd just patch away the unnecessary sync_fs().
