Ah, mostly unused sb meant read once for all data pages on that sb for
each few days (updatedb might be wrong example, because it's meta
data. Umm... maybe likely example is backup process). I guess it will be
"put" all pages into backend, and would "flush" useful caches. So, I
think overhead and reclaim pressure are noticeable impact.

Ok, but if now it's concentrating on interface for backend of this, I
think it can be later.

Thanks for info.
