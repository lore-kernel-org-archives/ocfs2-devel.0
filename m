One use case of cleancache is to provide transparent page cache compression
support. Currently, I'm working 'zcache' which provides hooks for cleancache
callbacks to implement the same.

Page cache compression is expected is benefit use cases where memory is the
bottleneck. In particular, I'm interested in KVM virtualization case where
this can allow running more VMs per host for given amount of RAM.

The zcache code is under active development and a working snapshot can be
found here:
http://code.google.com/p/compcache/source/browse/#hg/sub-projects/zcache
(sorry for lack of code comments in its current state)

Thanks,
Nitin
