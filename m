I might have misunderstood what you wanted or am misunderstanding you now.

I did not change the flush related code until the last patches. I added
REQ_OP_FLUSH in patch:

[PATCH 33/35] block, drivers: add REQ_OP_FLUSH operation
commit 18dea20363ba245a47bc1bb54f6465b8a05b19af

    block, drivers: add REQ_OP_FLUSH operation


and I added the REQ_PREFLUSH flag in


[PATCH 35/35] block, drivers, fs: rename REQ_FLUSH to REQ_PREFLUSH

    block, drivers, fs: rename REQ_FLUSH to REQ_PREFLUSH


I did them in separate patches, because I was not sure if they were
correct with what you requested before, and because they were a little
more tricky because of how request_fn drivers, make_request_fn drivers,
and dm-multipath handle flushes differently.
