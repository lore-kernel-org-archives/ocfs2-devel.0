They /do/ share/ code -- eventually both btrfs_extent_same and
btrfs_clone_files call btrfs_clone.  xfs and ocfs2 call the same paths
internally too; it's only the vfs helpers that have the extra page cache
comparisons if it's a dedup operation.

Sure.  I had begin to dislike typing RFR anyway.

(Will respond to these at the current end of the flags thread.)

We do, but vfs.txt hasn't been ported to any of that.
