Well, that's a problem regardless of whether new kernels return a
physical length by default or not. I think I'd prefer a flag that
says specifically whether the fe_phys_len field is valid or not. Old
kernels will never set the flag, new kernels can always set the
flag...

I think an explicit flag is better than relying on a flag that
defines the encoding to imply the physical length field is valid.

I'd think xfs_io is the first target - because we'll need xfstests
coverage of this before there's a filefrag release that supports
it...

Agreed.

Yup, pretty much what I was thinking.

Sounds like a good idea.

Well, it's moot if we decide a specific flag for the fe_phys_len
field being valid is decided on ;)
