Ok, I'll plumb the bytes-finished return value all the way through the
internal APIs.

Err... ok.  That makes working on this a little messy, we'll see if I
can get this mess rebased in time for 5.0.

I don't really like loff_t (why does the typename for a size include
"offset" in the name??) but I guess that's not horrible.  I've never
liked how functions take size_t (unsigned) but return ssize_t (signed)
anyway.
