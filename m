Unlinked-but-open files are the reason that XFS dirties the log
after the freeze process is complete. This ensures that if the
system crashes while the filesystem is frozen then log recovery
during the next mount will process the unlinked (orphaned) inodes
and free the correctly. i.e. you can still freeze a filesystem with
inodes in this state successfully and have everythign behave as
you'd expect.

I'm not sure how other filesystems handle this problem, but perhaps
pushing this check down into filesystem specific code or adding a
superblock feature flag might be a way to allow filesystems to
handle this case in the way they think is best...

Cheers,

Dave.
