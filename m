IMHO, your description succeeded at that. I'm hoping that the final patch
can have mostly generic code, like FIBMAP does today.

Oh, ok great - I was primarily looking for a way to say "there's allocation
past i_size" and it looks like we have it.

Well, fe_offset and fe_length are already expressed in bytes, so we could
just put the byte offset to where the inline data starts in there. fe_length
is just used as the length allocated for inline-data.

If fe_offset is required to be block aligned, then we could add a field to
express an offset within the block where data would be found - say
'fe_data_start_offset'. In the non-inline case, we could guarantee that
fe_data_start_offset is zero. That way software which doesn't want to care
whether something is inline-data (for example, a backup program) or not
could just blidly add it to fe_offset before looking at the data.

Regardless, I think we also want to explicitely flag this:

#define FIEMAP_EXTENT_DATA_IN_INODE 0x00000400 /* extent data is stored in inode block */


I'm going to pretend that I completely understand reiserfs tail-packing and
say that my approaches above looks like they could work for that case too.
We'd want to add a seperate flag for tail packed data though.

Sure, but I think whatever goes upstream should be able to handle this case
- there's file systems in use _today_ which put data in inode blocks and
pack file tails.
