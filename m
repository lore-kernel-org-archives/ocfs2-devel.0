Thanks for debugging this! Just a few minor nits:

1) Please use at least 12 characters of the commit hash - i.e. de92c8caf16c
- that is pretty much guaranteed to stay unique for the lifetime of Linux.
Using just 7 characters will become non-unique with high probability rather
soon.

2) Send this patch to Ted Tso as well as he is the one merging jbd2
patches.

3) The fact that OCFS2 hit this problem means that it is mixing
jbd2_journal_get_write_access() and jbd2_journal_get_undo_access() for the
same buffer. That is slightly suspicious to me. Not that it would be
outright bug but you have to account for the fact that someone can be
modifying the buffer data while you are getting undo access...

4) Some other comments below in the code.

Use 'bool' please. The function is already using bools so it is good for
consistency.

Short comment here please. Like:

	/* For undo access buffer must have data copied */

Here 'false' instead of 0.

Here 'true' instead of 1.

Thanks.
