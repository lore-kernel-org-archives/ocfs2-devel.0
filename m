	Thanks!

	I'm certain, as you've surmised, that a lot of this affects
ocfs2 as well.  jbd2 improvements make both filesystems better.

	The atomic changes make absolute sense.  Ack on them.  I had two
reactions to the rwlock: first, a lot of your rwlock changes are on
the write_lock() side.  You get journal start/stop parallelized, but
what about all the underlying access/dirty/commit paths?  Second,
rwlocks are known to behave worse than spinlocks when they ping the
cache line across CPUs.
	That said, I have a hunch that you've tested both of the above
concerns.  You mention 48 core systems, and clearly if cachelines were
going to be a problem, you would have noticed.  So if the rwlock changes
are faster on 48 core than the spinlocks, I say ack ack ack.
	From the ocfs2 perspective, the code is perfectly safe, and any
speedup you see on ext4 ought to be mirrored on ocfs2.
