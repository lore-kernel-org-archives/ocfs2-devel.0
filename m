  So there are two reasons:
1) Currently if you call quotactl() with invalid quota type you'll get
EINVAL. To maintain this with addition of project quotas you need to check
the types early before calling check_quotactl_permission() and other
checks.

2) I didn't want filesystem quotactl callbacks to deal with quota types
they don't support. Sure each fs could do a type check in the callback but
this looked easier.

Now I see your point about s_dquot and I can move allowed_types out of
s_dquot if that makes you happier. But otherwise what I did still seems as
the best solution to me.
