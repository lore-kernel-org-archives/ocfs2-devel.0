Don't you also have to test if dqopt->ops[qid->type] is NULL?  e.g.,
if the quota inode hasn't been loaded for that quota type?

Also, I notice you have this queued on the for_next branch and not the
for_linus branch.  I was hoping you could push this to Linus sooner
than the next merge cycle, since this is (a) making my testing hard,
and (b) it makes it easy for an attacker to crash the system.  For
similar reasons, perhaps this should have a cc: stable at vger.kernel.org
tag?

Thanks,
