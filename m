Uh, we're changing function signatures /and/ redefinining vm_fault_t?
All in the same 90K patch?

I /was/ expecting a series of "convert XXXXX and all callers/users"
patches followed by a trivial one to switch the definition, not a giant
pile of change.  FWIW I don't mind so much if you make a patch
containing a change for some super-common primitive and a hojillion
little diff hunks tree-wide, but only one logical change at a time for a
big patch, please...

I quite prefer seeing the whole series from start to finish all packaged
up in one series, but wow this was overwhelming. :/
