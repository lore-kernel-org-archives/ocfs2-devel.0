I ran the script with "35-rc4 + this patch version" for an ocfs2 volume, 
and get no hang now. Thanks for the work. I also have some number for 
you. See below.

Just some updates from the test of ocfs2.
                   fs_mark
  ------------------------
  deadline        386.3
  vanilla cfq     59.7
  patched cfq     366.2

So there is really a fantastic improvement at least from what fs_mark 
gives us. Great thanks.
