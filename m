	Let me add my name to the chorus of "we have to handle freezing
with open+unlinked, we cannot assume they don't exist."

	Others have pointed out that we can flag the safe filesystems.
I'd even be willing to say you can't freeze the unsafe filesystems.

	Given that frozen filesystems can stay that way for a while,
couldn't that lead to a million frozen df(1)s?  It's like your average
NFS network failure.

	Perhaps we handle iput() like unlinked.  If the filesystem can
handle it, we allow it, otherwise we block.
