OK so ia64 gcc is broken in regard to __attribute__((packed(1))),
and it should not be used.
But clearly the programmer, Like in this patch exactly, should spell
out the hole created by padding and spell that hole out and call it
__Padding. The porgrammer thought about it, identified there is an hole,
please don't drop this information on the floor. Put it in the code so I 
don't have to break my head on it.

change that to
	__u32		__padding_hole;

Drop the evil __packed but show me the padding
