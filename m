After thinking about this some more, I can see a way
to enforce "opt-in" in the cleancache backend without
any changes to non-generic fs code.   I think it's a horrible
hack and we can try it, but I expect fs maintainers
would prefer the explicit one-line-patch opt-in.

1) Cleancache backend maintains a list of "known working"
   filesystems (those that have been tested).

2) Nitin's proposed changes pass the *sb as a parameter.
  The string name of the filesystem type is available via
  sb->s_type->name.  This can be compared against
  the "known working" list.

Using the sb pointer as a "handle" requires an extra
table search on every cleancache get/put/flush,
and fs/super.c changes are required for fs unmount
notification anyway (e.g. to call cleancache_flush_fs)
so I'd prefer to keep the cleancache_poolid addition
to the sb.  I'll assume this is OK since this is in generic
fs code.
