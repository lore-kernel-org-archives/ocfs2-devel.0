  Sorry, I've confused frozen_data with committed_data. Buffer with
frozen_data happens quite often. So your fix is really needed.

  Yeah, I was just wondering why we don't do:
jbd2_buffer_abort_trigger(jh)
  and choose the proper set of triggers in the jbd2_buffer_abort_trigger()
function (and similarly for the commit trigger). Or does it make sence
to not call frozen trigger in some place if there're frozen data set?
