Hi, Dan,

Sorry for commenting on your post so late. I've had some time to read
through your approach and compare it to my approach 
(http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2010/view_abstract.php?content_key=32)
and I had a few quick questions

1. Can't this be done at the MM layer - why the filesystem hooks? Is
it to enable faster block devices in the reclaim hierarchy?
2. I don't see a mention of slabcache in your approach, reclaim free
pages or freeing potentially free slab pages.
