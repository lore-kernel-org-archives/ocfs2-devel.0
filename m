statx sounds good to me, but I'd really like to hear from Christian.

Sounds good.

There's definitively nothing in NFS, speaking as the person who added
the clone support.  If your new Linux syscall API becomes widely useful,
we could add the equivalent to NFS in a new draft.

I just mean we need some way to discover it.  I think the three states
in statx should cover everything.

Yes.

Yes.

It is hard to know that nothing is shared, because nothing in the
inode tracks the shared space, except for XFS_DIFLAG2_REFLINK only
the reflink btree shared if anyting is reflinked.   To efficiently
clear the bit in an exact way we'd need to track the number of
blocks or extents that are shared in the inode, which would be
an on-disk format change.  But if you run xfs_scrub with online
repair enable, the online repair can fix the value up as background
operation, which should be useful once that feature has matured a
bit and users enable it by default.

Interesting.  Maybe we need a sync before calling
xfs_reflink_inode_has_shared_extents?

Happy to help reviewing this if you take on a word.  Just as a warning
I'm a bit overloaded currently, so some replies might take longer than
I'd want.
