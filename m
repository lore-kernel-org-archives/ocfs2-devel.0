I'd prefer to just see the new physical length field always filled
out, regardless of whether it is a compressed extent or not. In
terms of backwards compatibility to userspace, it makes no
difference because the value of reserved/unused fields is undefined
by the API. Yes, the implementation zeros them, but there's nothing
in the documentation that says "reserved fields must be zero".
Hence I think we should just set it for every extent.

From the point of view of the kernel API (fiemap_fill_next_extent),
passing the physical extent size in the "len" parameter for normal
extents, then passing 0 for the "physical length" makes absolutely
no sense.

IOWs, what you have created is a distinction between the extent's
"logical length" and it's "physical length". For uncompressed
extents, they are both equal and they should both be passed to
fiemap_fill_next_extent as the same value. Extents where they are
different (i.e.  encoded extents) is when they can be different.
Perhaps fiemap_fill_next_extent() should check and warn about
mismatches when they differ and the relevant flags are not set...

The comment for fe_length needs to change, too, because it needs to
indicate that it is the logical extent length and that it may be
different to the fe_phys_length depending on the flags that are set
on the extent.

And, FWIW, I wouldn't mention specific flags in the comment here,
but do it at the definition of the flags that indicate there is
a difference between physical and logical extent lengths....

i.e. here.
