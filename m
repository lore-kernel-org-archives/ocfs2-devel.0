I tend to agree, but the additional complication here is that this is
a change to an existing API.  We'd need another HAVE_PHYS_LEN flag for
non-compressed extents so that userspace can rely on it.  Given that
it's only useful for that case I think the userspace API introduced
is the best we can get.

I think however that we should always pass the phys_len argument in the
kernel API just to make it less confusing.
