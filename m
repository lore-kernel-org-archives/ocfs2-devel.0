So I have a similar tool queued up in ocfs2-tools. Named puncher.
http://oss.oracle.com/git/?p=ocfs2-tools.git;a=shortlog;h=puncher

I'll pull it out if we get something in util-linux. But maybe you can 
extract something useful from it.

Like.... maybe doing dry-run as default. It is an inplace modification
after all. Also using a large hole size as default (1MB). Over using 
hole punching will negatively affect read performance. We should make 
the sane choice for the user.

On a related note, it may make sense for ext4 to populate the cluster 
size (bigalloc) in stat.st_blksize.

2 cents...
