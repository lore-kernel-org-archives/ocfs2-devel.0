No the natural alignment is what it is, after the application of
__attribute__((packed(1))). In a well defined structure that is a no-opt.
But yes in ai64 the gcc programmers got lazy and did not make that analysis
after laying out the structure.

The base address can be unaligned even if the structure is aligned. In that
case you need the __atrubute__((aligned)) thingy. It is true that if the sizeof(foo_packed)
is though unaligned, the compiler will have to assume unalignment in array operations.
but if the sizeof(foo_packed) is naturally aligned at the output then the compiler
has all the needed information to know that even if I declared __packed, it calculated
and knows that it is well aligned at the end.

Please note that I gave up on the compiler and understand that the use of __packed
is dangerous in some cases, sigh. My standing point is to make sure there are no guesses
left, and a BUILD_BUG_ON to make sure of that.
