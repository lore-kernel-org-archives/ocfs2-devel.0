Tristan,

The reflink test is missing aio bits. Please could you add it.
In short, a pread issued after an aio write, must return that
data. This should be tested for both direct and buffered ios.

Similarly, fill_holes also needs to be enhanced.

Thanks
Sunil

Some filesystems (XFS and ext4) have support for a concept called
unwritten extents, where we can write data into holes / preallocated
space and only mark them as allocated when the data I/O has finished.

Because the transaction to convert the extent can't be submitted from
I/O completion, which normally happens from IRQ context it needs to
be defered to a workqueue.  This is not a problem for buffered I/O
where we keep the data in cache at least until the I/O operation has
finished, but it is an issue for direct I/O.  XFS avoids that problem
for synchronous direct I/O by waiting for all unwritten extent conversions
to finish if we did one during direct I/O, but so far has ignored the
problem for asynchronous I/O.  Unfortunately the race is very easy
to hit by using QEMU with native AIO support on a sparse image, and
the result is filesystem corruption in the guest.

This contains core direct I/O changes to allow the filesystem to delay
AIO completion, as well as a patch to fix XFS.  ext4 also has the same
issue, and from a quick look also doesn't properly complete unwritten
extent conversions for synchronous direct I/O, but I'll leave that
for someone more familar to figure out.

Below is a minimal reproducer for the issue.  Given that we're dealing
with a race condition it doesn't always fail, but in 2 core laptop
it triggers 100% reproducibly in 20 runs in a loop.
