Heh, this "pushing of responsibility" looks like a silly game. If an error
can happen in a function, it is better to report it as far as easily
possible (unless we can cleanly handle it which we cannot here). I'm guilty
of making dquot_free_inode() ignore errors from mark_all_dquot_dirty() and
in retrospect it would have been better if these were propagated to the
caller as well. And eventually we can fix this if we decide we care enough.
I'm completely fine with just returning an error from dquot_free_inode()
and ignore it in all the callers except for ext4. Then filesystems which
care enough can try to handle the error. That way we at least don't
increase the design debt from the past.
