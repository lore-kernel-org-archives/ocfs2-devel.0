	Ok, looking at your first email again, you're saying to move up
to the "Check for escaping" section.  There we might checksum b_data
before it's copied out.  This is, indeed, safe against the problem you
mentioned.  I also think it's safe to checksum b_frozen_data if already
set there, as that's a frozen for commit buffer.  Can I trust that
checksumming b_data there will not be overwritten by another process
doing journal_dirty_metadata() before we write out our buffer?  Can I
trust that the b_frozen_data, if already copied, will be the buffer
committed and checkpointed?  If so, I think that change works.
