Oh, I was confused as to what you are asking.  Mapping in-inode data is
just fine using the existing interface.  The byte offset of the data is
given, and the "FIEMAP_EXTENT_NO_DIRECT" flag is set to indicate that it
isn't necessarily safe to do IO directly to that byte offset in the file
(e.g. tail packed, compressed data, etc).

I was thinking you were asking how to map metadata (e.g. indirect blocks).

Cheers, Andreas
