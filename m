  I was wondering about 'mode' vs 'flags' as well. The manpage says:
The mode argument determines the operation to be performed on the given
range.  Currently only one flag is supported for mode...
  So we call it "mode" but speak about "flags"? Seems a bit inconsistent.
I'd maybe lean a bit at the "flags" side and just make sure that
only one of FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE, FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE is set (interpreting
FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE as allocate blocks beyond i_size). But I'm not sure
what others think.
