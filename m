I picked these because they are fairly isolated from all other uses,
in particular since inode times are the only things where we really
care about times in the distant past or future (decades away as opposed
to things that happened between boot and shutdown).

For other kernel-internal uses, we may be better off migrating to
a completely different representation, such as nanoseconds since
boot or the architecture specific ktime_t, but this is really something
to decide for each subsystem.

I just tried building an arm32 kernel with a s64 time_t, and that
failed horribly, I get linker errors for missing 64-bit divides
and lots of warnings for code that expects time_t pointers to
functions taking a 'long' or vice versa. I also think the only
way to maintain ABI compatibility is to separate the internal uses
from the interface, which means auditing all code in the end.
