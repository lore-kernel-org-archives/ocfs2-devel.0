  OK, QUOTA_TYPE_USR etc. looks good. I'm not so sure about named enum. I'd
be fine with named enum for USRQUOTA, GRPQUOTA, etc. - i.e., types which
should have one of the named values but for a bitmask with arbitrary
combinations of flags it looks confusing to me (although technically
it would work).
