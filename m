Well, you can just make dquot_free_inode() return error. Now most callers
won't be able to do much with an error from dquot_free_inode() but that's
the case also for other things during inode deletion - just handle it as
other fatal failures during inode freeing.

That would be somewhat better than what you do in this patch but I prefer
to handle this like I suggested above.
