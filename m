I've looked in detail at all the patches in this version now, and while
overall everything is fine, I found that two patches cannot be part of the
series because of the dependency on the patch that John already took (adding
time64_to_tm), but I think that's ok because we just need to change over
all the users of CURRENT_TIME and CURRENT_TIME_SEC that assign to inode
timestamps in order to prepare for the type change, the other ones
can be changed later.

I also found a few things that could be done differently to make the
later conversion slightly easier, but it's also possible that I missed
part of your bigger plan for those files, and none of them seem important.
