I can't reproduce this, unfortunately.  Also, when building with the
.config you sent me, the disassembly doesn't line up with the stack
trace you posted.

I'm not sure why yielding the queue would cause a deadlock.  The only
explanation I can come up with is that I/O is not being issued.  I'm
assuming that no other I/O will be completed to the file system in
question.  Is that right?  Could you send along the output from sysrq-t?

Cheers,
Jeff
