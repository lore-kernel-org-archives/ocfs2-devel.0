So I think you should just pass one any of the two inodes and just add
a comment.

Then, if we hit a filesystem that actually wants to have different
granularity for different inodes, we'll split it up, but even then
we'd be better off than with the superblock, since then we *could*
easily split this one case up into "get directory time" and "get inode
time".

The thing is, those kinds of things are all going to be inside the
filesystem itself.

At that point, the *filesystem* already knows what the timekeeping
rules for that filesystem is.

I think we should strive to design the "current_fs_time()" not for
internal filesystem use, but for actual generic use where we *don't*
know a priori what the rules are, and we have to go to this helper
function to figure it out.

Inside a filesystem, why *shouldn't* the low-level filesystem already
use the normal "get time" functions?

See what I'm saying? The primary value-add to "current_fs_time()" is
for layers like the VFS and security layer that don't know what the
filesystem itself does.

At the low-level filesystem layer, you may just know that "ok, I only
have 32-bit timestamps anyway, so I should just use a 32-bit time
function".

But those already have an inode.

In fact, ext4 is a particularly bad example, since it uses the
ext4_current_time() function to get the time. And that one gets an
inode pointer.

So at least one filesystem that already does this, already uses a
inode-based model.

Everything I see just says "times are about inodes". Anything else
almost has to be filesystem-internal anyway, since the only thing that
is ever visible outside the filesystem (time-wise) is the inode.

And as mentioned, once it's internal to the low-level filesystem, it's
not obvious at all that you'd have to use "currenf_fs_time()" anyway.
The internal filesystem code might very well decide to use other
timekeeping functions.
