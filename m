[Added jbd2 Ccs.  Sorry about the whole-patch-quote, but I want jbd2
 folks to see what we're doing.]

	This is completely unsafe.  Two reasons.  First, you're checking
the journal features after ocfs2_journal_load() has done recovery.  This
may or may not be safe; recovering a 32bit journal probably works even
on a 64bit filesystem, and we shouldn't see that combination in the
wild anyway.  That's not so bad.
	Far worse is that you might recover a 64bit journal before
you've checked the sector_t or pagecache limits.  That's not acceptable.
	I think the best solution is to check all the limits before you
load the journal.  However, jbd2 doesn't quite let you do that yet.
Thus, I propose the following jbd2 patch.  jbd2 people, what do you
think:

diff --git a/fs/jbd2/journal.c b/fs/jbd2/journal.c
index bc2ff59..7922d87 100644
--- a/fs/jbd2/journal.c
+++ b/fs/jbd2/journal.c

	if (journal->j_format_version == 1)
		return 0;

	If the jbd2 maintainers will allow this patch, you can put
together a two-change series that first modifies jbd2 and then adds
ocfs2_check_addressable() *before* ocfs2_journal_load().
