If we race with commit code setting i_transaction to NULL, we could possibly
dereference it. Proper locking requires journal pointer (journal->j_list_lock)
we don't have. So we have to change the prototype of the function so that
filesystem passes us the journal pointer. Also add more detailed comment
about why function does what it does how it should be used.

Thanks to Dan Carpenter <error27@gmail.com> for pointing to the suspitious
code.
