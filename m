Well, the normal thing for XFS is that a production kernel cleans up
and handles the error gracefully with a WARN_ON_ONCE, while a debug
kernel build will chuck a tanty and burn the house down so to make
the developers aware that there is a "should not happen" situation
occurring....

None of these are appealing.

why would we double unlock the page?

Oh, the readahead cursor doesn't handle the case of partial page
submission, which would result in IO completion unlocking the page.

Ok, that's what the ctx.cur_page_in_bio check is used to detect i.e.
if we've got a page that the readahead cursor points at, and we
haven't actually added it to a bio, then we can leave it to the
read_pages() to unlock and clean up. If it's in a bio, then IO
completion will unlock it and so we only have to drop the submission
reference and move the readahead cursor forwards so read_pages()
doesn't try to unlock this page. i.e:

	/* clean up partial page submission failures */
	if (ctx.cur_page && ctx.cur_page_in_bio) {
		put_page(ctx.cur_page);
		readahead_next(rac);
	}

looks to me like it will handle the case of "ret == 0" in the actor
function just fine.

Cheers,

Dave.
