I tried to make it as Lustre-agnostic as possible...

Note the distinction between "fe_offset" (which is a physical offset for
a single extent) and "fm_offset" (which is a logical offset for that file).

You're right, thanks.

_EOF == beyond i_size.
_LAST == last extent in the file.

In most cases FIEMAP_EXTENT_EOF will be set at the same time as
FIEMAP_EXTENT_LAST, but in case of e.g. prealloc beyond i_size the 
EOF flag may be set on one or more earlier extents.

Hmm, but part of the issue would be how to request the extra data, and
what offset it would be given?  One could, for example, use negative
offsets to represent metadata or something, or add a FIEMAP_EXTENT_META
or similar, I hadn't given that much thought.  The other issue is that
I'd like to get the basics of the API in place before it gets too complex.
We can always add functionality with more FIEMAP_FLAG_* (whether in the
INCOMPAT range or not, depending on what is being done).

Cheers, Andreas
