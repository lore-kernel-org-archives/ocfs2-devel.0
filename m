I see the backward compatibility issue now. The patches (up to v4)
updated all filesystems to fill the physical length with logical,
but this should be 0 to keep the backward compatibility and also to keep
the changes to existing fiemap users minimal.

So for v5, PHYS_LENGTH will be introduced but only used by btrfs
together with ENCODED and COMPRESSED. Though this may look too much for
my needs to represent compressed extent, it is flexible for future use.

Sounds good to me.

It could save some bytes, but I don' see it too practical. I expect the
amount of zeroed blocks to be low on average and the current compression
methods are able to squeeze long runs of zeros to a few tens of bytes
per page.
