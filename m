I think we should hoist the MAX_RW_COUNT/2 limit to the VFS helpers
since afaict we generally cap max IO per call at MAX_RW_COUNT.  (I
probably should've capped ocfs2 back when I did xfs, but forgot).  If
btrfs wants to keep their lower (16M) limit then they're free to do so;
the interface documentation allows for this.  One of the btrfs
developers seems to be working on a patch series to raise the limit[1]
anyway.
