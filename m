OK, I guess I am displaying my kernel-newbie-ness... though,
in this case, writeback of a cleancache page to backing store
doesn't make much sense either (since cleancache pages are
by definition "clean").

I'm happy to rename the hooks, though will probably not
repost a V9 unless/until more substantive changes collect...
unless someone considers this an unmergeable offense.

Thanks for the feedback, Minchan and Andrew!
