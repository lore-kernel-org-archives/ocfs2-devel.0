Yeah, that's what I meant by "it would require changing all of the
callers".

The problem though is we need to make sure none of the callers don't
try to do anything else with handle besides calling
jbd2_journal_stop().  In particular, we can't allow a call to
jbd2_journal_get_write_access(), jbd2_journal_revoke() to operate on
the handle, because its transaction pointer is (potentially) invalid.

The handle->h_aborted bit, which is currently not used, does most of
the right thing, modulo the question of the fact that
jbd2_journal_stop() will return an error.  What's important from my
perspective is that the various callers that operate on a handle check
is_handle_aborted() before trying to use the it.  We'll still need to
audit the callers to make sure there isn't some uncommon-taken code
path where ext4_handle_dirty_metadata() gets called after
ext4_journal_restart() has returned an error.

As a FAST paper once opined, "EIO: Error Handling Is Occasionally correct".  :-)

Yes, that could work, although we'll need to check to make sure all of
the code paths that invoke jbd2_journal_restart() handle errors
appropriately, and don't rely on jbd2_journal_stop() returning an
error.  Thanks for your thoughts!
