Again - using the inode instead fo the syuperblock in tghis patch
would have made the patch much more obvious (it could have been 99%
generated with the sed-script I sent out a week or two ago), and it
would have made it unnecessary to add these kinds of things:

where we add a new variable just because the calling convention was wrong.

It's not even 100% obvious that a filesystem has to have one single
time representation, so making the time function about the entity
whose time is set is also conceptually a much better model, never mind
that it is just what every single user seems to want anyway.

So I'd *much* rather see

+       inode->i_atime = inode->i_mtime = inode->i_ctime =
current_fs_time(inode);

over seeing either of these two variants::

+       inode->i_atime = inode->i_mtime = inode->i_ctime =
current_fs_time(inode->i_sb);
+       ret->i_atime = ret->i_mtime = ret->i_ctime = current_fs_time(sb);

because the first of those variants (grep for current_fs_time() in the
current git tree, and notice that it's the common one) we have the
pointless "let's chase a pointer in every caller"

And while it's true that the second variant is natural for *some*
situations, I've yet to find one where it wasn't equally sane to just
pass in the inode instead.
