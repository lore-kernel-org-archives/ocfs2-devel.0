From: Derek Basehore <dbasehore@chromium.org>

bdi_wakeup_thread_delayed() used the mod_delayed_work() function to
schedule work to writeback dirty inodes. The problem with this is that
it can delay work that is scheduled for immediate execution, such as the
work from sync_inodes_sb().  This can happen since mod_delayed_work()
can now steal work from a work_queue.  This fixes the problem by using
queue_delayed_work() instead. This is a regression caused by
839a8e8660b6 "writeback: replace custom worker pool implementation with
unbound workqueue".

The reason that this causes a problem is that laptop-mode will change
the delay, dirty_writeback_centisecs, to 60000 (10 minutes) by default.
In the case that bdi_wakeup_thread_delayed() races with
sync_inodes_sb(), sync will be stopped for 10 minutes and trigger a hung
task. Even if dirty_writeback_centisecs is not long enough to cause a
hung task, we still don't want to delay sync for that long.

We fix the problem by using queue_delayed_work() when we want to
schedule writeback sometime in future. This function doesn't change the
timer if it is already armed.

For the same reason, we also change bdi_writeback_workfn() to
immediately queue the work again in the case that the work_list is not
empty. The same problem can happen if the sync work is run on the rescue
worker.
