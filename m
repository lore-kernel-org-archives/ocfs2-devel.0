	I realized, well, that I'm an idiot.  The previous patch has a
significant bug: what if a block is deallocated, then reused as a
different type of metadata, all before the committing transaction gets
around to firing the triggers?  It could use the new block type's
triggers against the b_frozen_data of the old block type.
	The easy answer is to add b_frozen_triggers alongside
b_frozen_data.  Here's the new patch.
	We'd like to submit this for the merge window with the ocfs2
meteaecc code.  We'll do that via ocfs2.git, as Ted recommended.

Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: Add buffer triggers

Filesystems often to do compute intensive operation on some
metadata.  If this operation is repeated many times, it can be very
expensive.  It would be much nicer if the operation could be performed
once before a buffer goes to disk.

This adds triggers to jbd2 buffer heads.  Just before writing a metadata
buffer to the journal, jbd2 will optionally call a commit trigger associated
with the buffer.  If the journal is aborted, an abort trigger will be
called on any dirty buffers as they are dropped from pending
transactions.

ocfs2 will use this feature.

Initially I tried to come up with a more generic trigger that could be
used for non-buffer-related events like transaction completion.  It
doesn't tie nicely, because the information a buffer trigger needs
(specific to a journal_head) isn't the same as what a transaction
trigger needs (specific to a tranaction_t or perhaps journal_t).  So I
implemented a buffer set, with the understanding that
journal/transaction wide triggers should be implemented separately.

There is only one trigger set allowed per buffer.  I can't think of any
reason to attach more than one set.  Contrast this with a journal or
transaction in which multiple places may want to watch the entire
transaction separately.

The trigger sets are considered static allocation from the jbd2
perspective.  ocfs2 will just have one trigger set per block type,
setting the same set on every bh of the same type.
