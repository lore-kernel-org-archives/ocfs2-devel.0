We need interrupts disabled when calling console_trylock_for_printk()
only so that cpu id we pass to can_use_console() remains valid (for
other things console_sem provides all the exclusion we need and
deadlocks on console_sem due to interrupts are impossible because we use
down_trylock()).  However if we are rescheduled, we are guaranteed to
run on an online cpu so we can easily just get the cpu id in
can_use_console().

We can lose a bit of performance when we enable interrupts in
vprintk_emit() and then disable them again in console_unlock() but OTOH
it can somewhat reduce interrupt latency caused by console_unlock().

We differ from (reverted) commit 939f04bec1a4 in that we avoid calling
console_unlock() from vprintk_emit() with lockdep enabled as that has
unveiled quite some bugs leading to system freezes during boot (e.g.
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/5/30/242,
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/6/28/521).
